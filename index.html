<p><h2>Description</h2>
  
  

<p>
GUAVA is a package that implements coding theory 
algorithms in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>. 

Codes can  be created and manipulated  and
 information about codes can be calculated.
</p>

<p>
GUAVA consists of various files written in the <b>GAP</b> language, and an
 external program (which requires a linux/unix system) 
from J.S. Leon for dealing with automorphism groups of 
codes and isomorphism testing functions (for the manual 
to his program, click <a href="leon_guava_manual.pdf">here</a> for the pdf). 
Several algorithms that need the speed are integrated in the 
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> kernel. 
Please send your bug reports 
to <a href="mailto:support@gap-system.org">support</a>. 
</p>


<p>
The functions within GUAVA can be divided into four categories:
</p>

<p>
<ul>

<li>  Construction of codes. GUAVA can construct non-linear, linear and 
cyclic codes over an arbitrary finite field. 
Examples are <strong>HadamardCode</strong>, <strong>ReedMullerCode</strong>, 
<strong>BestKnownLinearCode</strong>, <strong>QRCode</strong> and 
<strong>GoppaCode</strong>.</li>

<li>  Manipulation of codes. These functions allow the user to transform 
one code into another or to construct a new code from two codes. Examples 
are <strong>PuncturedCode</strong>, <strong>DualCode</strong>, 
<strong>DirectProductCode</strong> and <strong>UUVCode</strong>.</li>

<li>  Computation of information about codes. This information is stored in 
the code record. Examples are <strong>MinimumDistance</strong>, 
<strong>OuterDistribution</strong>, <strong>IsSelfDualCode</strong> and 
<strong>AutomorphismGroup</strong>.
</li>

<li>  Generation of bounds on linear codes. The table by Brouwer and 
Verhoeff (as it existed in the mid 1990's)
is incorporated into GUAVA. For example,
<strong>BoundsMinimumDistance</strong>.
</li>

</ul>



<p><center>
<b>History</b>
</center>
<p>
GUAVA was originally written in the 1990's
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 3  
by  Jasper  Cramwinckel,  Erik
Roijackers, and Reinald Baart as a final project during their study of 
Mathematics at the Delft University of Technology, Department of  Pure
 Mathematics, under the direction of 
Professor Juriaan Simonis. This work was continued in
Aachen, at Lehrstuhl D fuer Mathematik. It appears version 1.1 was 
written around 1994 and 1.3 was around 1997. I don't 
know the date of the creation for 1.2.
</p> 


<p>
In version 1.3 (still 
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 3), 
new functions were added by Eric Minkes, 
also from Delft University of Technology.
</p>


<p>
Version 1.4 (the first GAP 4 version) of GUAVA  was  created 
around 1998 by Lea Ruscio who maintained it through to version 1.5.
</p>


<p>
Versions of GUAVA from 1.6 to 3.9 were maintained by 
David Joyner.

</p>


<p>Version 1.8 contained new commands for toric codes.</p>

<p>Version 2.0 was a significant upgrade, adding a number of new 
functions and a completely re-written manual. Starting with version
 2.0, the GUAVA package was released under the GPL.</p>

<p>Version 2.3 is a significant 
upgrade of version 2.0, adding a number of new functions.</p>

<p>Starting with Versions 2.5/2.6, GUAVA was forked: the "odd versions"
(e.g., 2.5, 2.7) include the code of J. S. Leon mentioned above (which was 
not licensed under the GPL at the time). 
The "even versions" (e.g., 2.6, 2.8) are entirely 
GPL'd, but are otherwise basically the same as the previous 
``odd version'' (i.e., "2.8 = 2.7 - non-GPL'd code"). 
</p>

<p>
Starting with Versions 2.7/2.8, Cen Tjhai, a PhD student in the
School of Computing, Communications &amp; Electronics at the University of 
Plymouth, was added as an author. He completely updated the tables, 
which have not been updated since 1998, and added some new functions. 
In April of 2007, Jeffrey Leon GPL'd his C code included in GUAVA. 
At that point, Robert Miller and Tom Boothby began to revise his code and 
fix bugs. As of Version 3.0, Robert Miller and Tom Boothby are authors 
and there is no longer an odd/even non-GPL/GPL fork of GUAVA.
</p>


<p>
As of 3.10, <a href="mailto:fieldsj1@southernct.edu">Joe Fields</a> is the lead maintainer.

<h2>Installation</h2>
</center>
<p>
To install GUAVA, as a <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 4 
package, unpack the 
archive file in a directory in the `pkg' hierarchy of your version of
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 4. 
(This might be the `pkg' directory of the 
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 4 home 
directory; it is however also possible to keep an additional `pkg' 
directory in your private directories, see section 
<a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/htm/ref/CHAP074.htm">
"Installing GAP Packages"</a> of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 4 
reference manual for details on how to do this.)
</p>

<p>
After unpacking GUAVA the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>-only 
part of GUAVA is installed.  The parts 
of GUAVA depending on J. Leon's backtrack programs package (for computing
automorphism groups) are only available in a UNIX environment, where you 
should proceed as follows:

</p>

<p>
<ul>

<li>
<i>32-bit linux (or windows cygwin) installation instructions</i>:

<p>
Go to the newly created `guava' directory and call `./configure <tt>GAPPATH</tt>'
where <tt>GAPPATH</tt> is the path to the <b>GAP</b> home directory. So for example, if 
you install the package in the main `pkg' directory call
</p>
<pre>./configure ../..</pre>
<br>


</p>

<p>This will fetch the architecture type for which <b>GAP</b> has been compiled 
last and create a `Makefile'. Now call 
<pre>make<br></pre> 
to compile the binary and to install it in the appropriate place.
</li>
<li>
<i>64-bit linux instructions</i>:

If the OS is 64-bit SUSE or Redhat linux, type
<pre>./configure ../.. --enable-libsuffix=64 <br>
make<br>
</pre>
to compile Leon's program as a 64 bit native binary. If you have 
Debian-based 64-bit linux then this still works but the simpler 
command <tt>./configure ../..</tt> will configure the 
compilation of the application by default as 64-bit.</li>


<li>
<i>Mac OS X instructions</i>:
The 32-bit linux instructions should work here as well.


<!--
Charles Wright discovered and Alexander Hulpke fixed a compilation 
error for compiling the binaries associated to GUAVA on a Mac running OS X. 
The C code (connecting GUAVA to the C-code written by J. Leon) 
included with GUAVA does not compile correctly on a Mac running OX. 
In this case,  on line 2 of
<tt>guava/src/leonconv.c</tt>, replace
<pre>#include &lt;malloc.h&gt;
</pre>
by
<pre>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</pre>
Compilation should now work if you follow the steps for a linux computer
above. 
-->
</li>

</ul>



<p>This completes the installation of GUAVA for a single architecture.  If 
you use this installation of GUAVA on different hardware platforms you
 will have to compile the binary for each platform separately. This is
 done by calling `configure' and `make' for the package anew
 immediately after compiling <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 
itself for the respective architecture.  If your version of 
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> is already compiled (and has last 
been compiled on the same architecture) you do not need to compile 
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> again; it is 
sufficient to call the `configure' script in the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 
home directory.



</p>

<p>
Hints for GUAVA installation <i>outside the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 
main directory</i>: When you don't have access to
the directory of your main <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> 
installation you can also install the package 
by unpacking inside a directory <tt>MYGAPDIR/pkg</tt>. (Don't forget to call "gap"
with the <tt>-l ";MYGAPDIR"</tt> option.) The only drawback with this installation 
is that in the HTML version of the package documentation the links to the
 main <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> manuals don't work.

<h3>
GUAVA and SAGE
</h3>
</center>
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to begin experimenting with GUAVA is to use it via the 
<a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/">SageMathCloud</a> (SMC).  One can 
sign up for a free SMC account or pay a small amount for a subscription
(which allows for premium access).  Within a SMC project one can create 
a sage worksheet and set its default language to GAP.  Then load GUAVA (see below)
and try out its features. 
</p>

</center>
</p>

<p>
 <h2>
Loading GUAVA
</h2>
</p>

<p>
After starting up <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>, 
the GUAVA package needs to be loaded. Load
 GUAVA by typing at the 
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> prompt:
</p>
<pre>gap&gt; LoadPackage( "guava" );</pre>
<br> 


</p> 

<p>
In fact, you can automate this by adding 

<pre>LoadPackage("guava");<br></pre> 
to your .gaprc file. However, if you wish to start GAP via a workspace
with GUAVA preloaded then you should type both
<tt>LoadPackage("sonata");</tt> and <tt>LoadPackage("guava");</tt> before
saving your workspace, since one command in GUAVA (versions 3.8 and higher) 
requires 
<a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/sonata.html">SONATA</a>.
